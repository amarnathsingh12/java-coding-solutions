## How to Run the Programs:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

2. **Navigate to the Solution Folder**:

3. **Compile and Run a Program**:

- For each problem, navigate to the respective Java file and compile it:
  ```
  javac ProblemX_Solution.java
  ```
- Run the program:
  ```
  java com.testsolutions.ProblemX_Solution
  ```

## Tests:

Each solution is tested with various test cases using **JUnit 5**. To run the tests, make sure you have JUnit 5 set up, then run the test classes.
